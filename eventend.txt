as events end, what needs to happen to the sheet?

when slice 1 ends, an updater must:
1) update C3 to the format "old event / new event" 
2) unhide column A

when any slice ends, an updater must:
1) Clear the count (D), update time(H), time of last flip(K), # of flips(M) for each CL
2) update the counts (D) with the most recent prejoin counts (Q) if it exists, with the appropriate update time (H)
3) set the event moniker (A) appropriately
4) unhide the Formulas worksheet to update "Event Ends" in column S with the new end date for the slice
 S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 updates Slice 1, Slice 2, Slice 3, Slice 4, Slice 5 respectively
 this updates the Updates worksheet with the new Event End Countdown for the slice
5) hide the Formulas worksheet

when slice 5 ends, an updater must:
1) update C3 to the format "new event"
2) hide column A
3) unhide the Formulas worksheet to update the active event(s) in W
	for 1 active event, update W16 based on the events table to the right (columns AA, AB)
	for 2 active events, update W18 for the second event
	this updates the Events worksheet by highlighting the row in yellow for the active event(s)
4) hide the Formulas worksheet


most of this can be taken care of automagically, once the next event is set by hand (or by bot command).
